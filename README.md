# üì± Carrier Info V3

- Imp , just a mere fork of original carrier_info to support on flutter 3x with latest gradle settings

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/carrier_info.svg?label=carrier_info&color=blue)](https://pub.dev/packages/carrier_info)

Carrier Info gets networkType, networkGeneration, mobileCountryCode, mobileCountryCode, e.t.c from both android and ios devices. It's a port from this [js project](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-carrier-info) and an improvement on the existing [flt_telephony_info package](https://pub.dev/packages/flt_telephony_info).

## ‚ú® Contribution

Lots of PR's would be needed to make this plugin standard, as for iOS there's a permanent limitation for getting the exact data usage, there's only one way around it and it's super complex.
